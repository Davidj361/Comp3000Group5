	\section{Introduction}
	
	\subsection{Context}
	Addressing this issue requires knowledge of what information is relevant to the calculation of memory and CPU (Central Processing Unit) resources, and how to get that information. Specifically, knowledge of the Linux '/proc/' file is needed.
	
	\subsection{Problem Statement}
	Computer users who are used to Windows might use Ctrl+Alt+Delete when they wish to see which processes are running and how much of the system's resources those processes are consuming. They may not be comfortable using the terminal to run commands that would display that information, and they might prefer to see the information in a Graphical User Interface (GUI). We would like to write a program that we can make accessible via the Ctrl-Alt-Delete keyboard shortcut that resembles the Windows Task Manager. It should allow for a clear and easy view of which processes are running and what resources each process is using. It should be easy to terminate a running process.
	
	\subsection{Result}
	We have written a program that is called on our system using the Ctrl-Alt-Delete keyboard shortcut. The program uses a GUI to display the running processes and the percentage of CPU resources and memory used by each process. The program allows users to easily select and terminate processes.
	
	\subsection{Outline}
	The rest of this report is structured as follows: Section 2 presents information about calculating system resource usage by specific processes using the Linux '/proc/' file; Section 3 describes the result of the project, which is the program we have written; Section 4 evaluates the result of the project; Section 5 is the conclusion.
	
	\section{Background Information}
	The Linux '/proc/' file system stores information about processes and also other system information. Each process has a directory in the '/proc/' file system (reference the textbook). The directory is created at '/proc/[pid]/', where pid is the process identification number. Each of these directories include a 'stat' file, and a 'statm'. In addition to the information about each process, there is also system information, i.e. the '/proc/cpuinfo' file and the '/proc/meminfo' file.\\
	The total memory used by a process can be calculated as follows:\\
	The total system memory can be located:\\
	The total amount of CPU usage by a process can be calculated as follows:\\
	The total amount of total CPU capacity can be calculated as follows:\\
	
Shortcuts, also known as hotkeys, that give functionality to applications are typically handled by event handler. Whenever a user presses a key on an operating system, an event is made and sent out for the event handlers to handle. An event is more than a key press or key release and there are many types of events, but for this text we will be discussing key presses and releases. Event handlers are in event loops. Event loops are embedded in applications themselves and/or in the operating system. Simple processes such as shell tools do not typically have event handlers, but many modern applications do.

The typical structure of an event loop is that goes through the queue of events it has, does what it needs and then chooses to dispatch the event or not, afterwards waiting for more events. 

The Qt framework offers a library in C++, and in other languages such as Python where it has been ported.
The Qt framework has an event loop and receives its events from X11, Wayland, etc.
This is explained by Thiago Macieira in his powerpoint on the Qt event loop\cite{QtSlides}.

For this example, we will talk about X11.
X11 is the base of the GUI system for Linux.
It handles all the communication between the user input and other windows because it is the framework that other applications are working off.
X11 has its own event loop, and is basically at the top of the hierarchy of event loops.

To interact with X11's event loop, you require
