### Created by: Trent McNabb & David Jatczak

# TODO LIST
- Make Proc.getTotalMem() more efficient
- Choose a polling rate and make Proc read its data for that interval, consider threading or see if the Proc class is on a separate thread
- Fix decimal places for ram precentage
- Have username actually translated to the proper username
- Implement sending signal via a right-click context menu on a process
- Give the program an option to launch on OS's startup
- Have ctrl-alt-del bring up a dialog to ask if you want to see task manager
- Have ctrl+shift+esc work as shortcut to bring up task manager
